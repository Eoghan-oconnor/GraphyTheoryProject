## Description
This project involved writing s program in the Go programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given
string of text. Also, we were required to write a regular expression engine rather than use the in built regexp package provided within Go.
