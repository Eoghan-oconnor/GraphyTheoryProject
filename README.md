# Graph Theory Project
## Name: Eoghan O'Connor
## Student ID: G00330972
## Module: Graph Theory
## Lecturer: Ian McLougnlin

## Description
This project involved writing s program in the Go programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given
string of text. Also, we were required to write a regular expression engine rather than use the in built regexp package provided within Go.

## Project Development
Upon receiving the project I began to investigate how nfas work and there real world application using my course page as a starting point.(https://learnonline.gmit.ie/course/view.php?id=4161). Futhermore videos provided to us by our lecturer helped greatly with the understanding of regexp engine creation and implementation, all of which are available from the above link.

## Running the project

This program requires the use of a complier.
If you do not have the GoLang complier installed please go to: https://golang.org and download the correct version for ypur os.

To clone the project run the following command in the command prompt
```
git clone https://github.com/Eoghan-oconnor/GraphyTheoryProject
```

To run the program navigate to the downloaded folder and run the following command 
```
go run nfaRunner.go
```
